### About
In the realm of traffic safety, our project introduces an immersive virtual-reality simulator. Users experience diverse driving scenarios, focusing on safety features like collision avoidance and adaptive cruise control. Our goal is to combat skepticism by showcasing modern driving practices that prioritize safety. The simulator serves as both an educational tool and research platform, encouraging a cultural shift toward safer driving practices through impactful demonstrations.


### Demos
Each demo consists of segments of "manual mode" driving, where the user has a physical steering wheel and accelerator/brakes and is controlling the vehicle, and an "autonomous mode" where the vehicle drives itself to showcase the correct driving practices.
